Hi, I’m @mars2699! :D
My main interests are Python, MATLAB, C++, as well as Arduino projects. 
I’m currently learning Python and Bash, and using GitHub as a place to practice my skills,
get feedback, and learn new things. My goal is to one day work as a systems engineer or 
software developer in the aerospace industry.
